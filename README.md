# hand-grasp-and-object-attribute

Python code for the study on mutual context between hand grasp types and object attributes.

The code is only tested in Ubuntu 14.08 with Python 2.7. For running the code, you also need prepare annotation file in yml format with our code in another project hand-object-annotation. The yml file generated may need to be transferred (using attribute.cpp) to be compatible with python.

Please cite the following paper if the code helps you:
